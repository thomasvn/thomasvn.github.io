				Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara University. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer and I'm always hungry to learn more.
				<br> <br>
				In my free time I enjoy getting active which can run from recreational football, to photography adventures. Since I find it hard to describe everything there is about me in a paragraph, below are some fun facts about me that might give you a better idea of who I am!

		    			<p>
		    				Ever since I joined Key Club in high school I have loved giving back to the community in any way I can. As a the Project Coordinator then President of the club, I Organized a wide scope of projects which ranged from mural paintings for the local hospital to crafting blankets for abused children.
		    				<br><br>
		    				Because of these experiences, much of what I do today is with a larger goal to give back to the community, especially with my degree.

		    			<h3>Cooking</h3>
		    			<p>
		    				Although I'm no expert yet, I have recently found a certain joy in cooking. I think the enjoyment comes moreso in the idea that this food revolves around people -- how it was introduced in a certain culture, how we can cook the food together, and how we can share the meal together.
		    				<br><br>
		    				I've found that the experiences created in this process have been much more special and worthwhile.
